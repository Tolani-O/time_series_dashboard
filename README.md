I'll continue the script to set up the futures visualization dashboard files.

I've created a comprehensive setup script for implementing the futures contract tick data visualization dashboard. Here's what the script will do:

### Setup Script Features

1. **Creates Project Structure**
   - Sets up a React application with all necessary files and directories
   - Configures Tailwind CSS for styling
   - Creates component and utility files structure

2. **Implements Components**
   - `FileSelector`: For selecting data files to visualize
   - `TimeRangeSlider`: For adjusting the time range of visualizations
   - `ChartTypeSelector`: For switching between different chart types
   - `TimeSeriesChart`: For visualizing price and size over time
   - `PriceDistributionChart`: For displaying price distribution histograms
   - `VolumeDistributionChart`: For showing volume distribution patterns
   - `BidAskSpreadChart`: For analyzing the bid-ask spread
   - `SummaryStatistics`: For displaying summary statistics of the datasets

3. **Utility Functions**
   - Data loading and parsing for CSV files
   - Data processing functions for each type of visualization

4. **Additional Files**
   - `README.md` with documentation for the project
   - Deployment script for building and deploying the application
   - Configuration files for Tailwind CSS

### Using the Script

1. Save the script as `setup-futures-visualization.sh`
2. Make it executable: `chmod +x setup-futures-visualization.sh`
3. Run it: `./setup-futures-visualization.sh`

Once the script completes, you'll have a fully functional React project that can be started with:

```bash
cd futures-visualization
npm install
npm start
```

### Real Data Loading Implementation

I've also provided a separate code snippet that shows how to implement real data loading from CSV files. To use it:

1. Replace the mock data loading functions in `src/utils/fileHandlers.js` with the real implementation
2. Update the `loadFileData` function in `App.js` to use the real data loading utilities

This will allow the dashboard to load actual CSV files generated by the `wrangle_data.py` script.

The dashboard will display time series data, price and volume distributions, bid-ask spread analysis, and summary statistics for the selected futures contract data files, meeting all the requirements specified in the project instructions.
